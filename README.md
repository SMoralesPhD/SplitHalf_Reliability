# SplitHalf_Reliability
These are two functions to do split-half reliability of EEG power and ERPs. The general approach follows the recommendations of Towers and Allen (2009) and was described in detail in Leach et al (2020). More recently, it was used in Troller-Renfree et al (under review) and Morales et al (under review) to estimate the reliability of EEG power and error-related ERPs and time-frequency power, respectively. Importantly, reliability estimates are a property of the scores rather than the measure and thus, they are context dependent and ideally should be examined and reported in each study. To facilitate this, we share these functions that we hope help others estimate the reliablity of their scores.
